Machine Learning Models

As per the dataset obtained from the secondary data source kaggle.com I have followed a statistical analysis on building a machine learning model accurately. Completion of explanatory data analysis, data pre-processing, data cleaning and performing a multiple linear regression model for the obtained dataset. The dataset consists of 4345 data with having 9 attributes for measuring which include both qualitative and quantitative variables. After loading the dataset several measures were taken to pre-process the dataset by evaluating missing values, determine the variables in interest, detecting of outliers etc. Then for the data cleaning process certain measures were taken for an instance removal of multicollinearity, checking the normality in the dependent variable etc. After proceeding with the following measures results says that exponential distribution exist in the variable where the use of log transformation method normality of the attribute is justified. Using the scaling of data measured scale is standardized and range of the attrbute is equalized and then i performed final processed cleaned dataset where i split it into two categories as train and test dataset.Then i followed by creation of linear regression model for prediction of price of used cars to accomplish the main objective of the analysis while being accomplished with other sub objectives.
